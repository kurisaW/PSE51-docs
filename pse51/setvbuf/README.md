# setvbuf — assign buffering to a stream

## SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int setvbuf(FILE *restrict stream, char *restrict buf, int type, size_t size);
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `setvbuf()` function may be used after the stream pointed to by `stream` is associated with an open file but before any other operation (other than an unsuccessful call to `setvbuf()`) is performed on the stream. The argument `type` determines how `stream` shall be buffered, as follows:

- `_IOFBF` shall cause input/output to be fully buffered.
- `_IOLBF` shall cause input/output to be line buffered.
- `_IONBF` shall cause input/output to be unbuffered.

If `buf` is not a null pointer, the array it points to may be used instead of a buffer allocated by `setvbuf()` and the argument `size` specifies the size of the array; otherwise, `size` may determine the size of a buffer allocated by the `setvbuf()` function. The contents of the array at any time are unspecified.

For information about streams, see [2.5 Standard I/O Streams](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_16_05).

## RETURN VALUE

Upon successful completion, `setvbuf()` shall return 0. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value if an invalid value is given for `type` or if the request cannot be honored, and may set `errno` to indicate the error.

## ERRORS

The `setvbuf()` function may fail if:

- **EBADF**: The stream is not a memory stream and the file descriptor underlying the stream is not valid.

## EXAMPLES

None.

## APPLICATION USAGE

A common source of error is allocating buffer space as an "automatic" variable in a code block, and then failing to close the stream in the same block.

With `setvbuf()`, allocating a buffer of `size` bytes does not necessarily imply that all of `size` bytes are used for the buffer area.

Applications should note that many implementations only provide line buffering on input from terminal devices.

## RATIONALE

None.

## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

None.

## CHANGE HISTORY

First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.

### Issue 6

Extensions beyond the ISO C standard are marked.

The `setvbuf()` prototype is updated for alignment with the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard.

### Issue 8

Austin Group Defect 1144 is applied, changing the [EBADF] error condition.
