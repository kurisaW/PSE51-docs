# fdopen

## SYNOPSIS

```c
[CX] #include <stdio.h>

FILE *fdopen(int fildes, const char *mode);
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `fdopen()` function shall associate a stream with a file descriptor.

The `mode` argument points to a character string that is valid for `fopen()`. If the string begins with one of the following characters, then the stream shall be associated with `fildes` as specified. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Mode Characters

**'r'**
- If `mode` includes '+', the associated stream shall be open for update (reading and writing)
- Otherwise, the stream shall be open for reading only
- If the open file description referenced by `fildes` has O_APPEND set, it shall remain set

**'w'**
- If `mode` includes '+', the associated stream shall be open for update (reading and writing)
- Otherwise, the stream shall be open for writing only
- The file shall not be truncated by the `fdopen()` call
- If the open file description referenced by `fildes` has O_APPEND set, it shall remain set

**'a'**
- If `mode` includes '+', the associated stream shall be open for update (reading and writing)
- Otherwise, the stream shall be open for writing only
- If the open file description referenced by `fildes` has O_APPEND clear, it is unspecified whether O_APPEND is set by the `fdopen()` call or remains clear

### Additional Mode Options

- The presence of 'x' in `mode` shall have no effect
- The FD_CLOEXEC flag of `fildes` shall be unchanged if 'e' is not present, and shall be set by the `fdopen()` call if 'e' is present
- Additional values for the `mode` argument may be supported by an implementation

### Requirements

The application shall ensure that the mode of the stream as expressed by the `mode` argument is allowed by the file access mode of the open file description to which `fildes` refers.

The file position indicator associated with the new stream is set to the position indicated by the file offset associated with the file descriptor.

The error and end-of-file indicators for the stream shall be cleared. The `fdopen()` function may cause the last data access timestamp of the underlying file to be marked for update.

[SHM] If `fildes` refers to a shared memory object, the result of the `fdopen()` function is unspecified.

[TYM] If `fildes` refers to a typed memory object, the result of the `fdopen()` function is unspecified.

The `fdopen()` function shall preserve the offset maximum previously set for the open file description corresponding to `fildes`.

## RETURN VALUE

Upon successful completion, `fdopen()` shall return a pointer to a stream; otherwise, a null pointer shall be returned and `errno` set to indicate the error.

## ERRORS

The `fdopen()` function shall fail if:

- **[EMFILE]** {STREAM_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling process.

The `fdopen()` function may fail if:

- **[EBADF]** The `fildes` argument is not a valid file descriptor.
- **[EINVAL]** The `mode` argument is not a valid mode.
- **[EMFILE]** {FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling process.
- **[ENOMEM]** Insufficient space to allocate a buffer.

## EXAMPLES

None.

## APPLICATION USAGE

File descriptors are obtained from calls like `open()`, `dup()`, `creat()`, or `pipe()`, which open files but do not return streams.

## RATIONALE

The file descriptor may have been obtained from `open()`, `creat()`, `pipe()`, `dup()`, `fcntl()`, or `socket()`; inherited through `fork()`, `posix_spawn()`, or `exec`; or perhaps obtained by other means.

The meanings of the `mode` arguments of `fdopen()` and `fopen()` differ. With `fdopen()`, write ('w') mode cannot create or truncate a file, and append ('a') mode cannot create a file. Inclusion of a 'b' in the `mode` argument is allowed for consistency with `fopen()`; the 'b' has no effect on the resulting stream. Implementations differ as to whether specifying append ('a') mode causes the O_APPEND flag to be set if it was clear, but they are encouraged to do so. Since `fdopen()` does not create a file, the 'x' mode modifier is silently ignored. The 'e' mode modifier is not strictly necessary for `fdopen()`, since FD_CLOEXEC must not be changed when it is absent; however, it is standardized here since that modifier is necessary to avoid a data race in multi-threaded applications using `freopen()`, and consistency dictates that all functions accepting `mode` strings should allow the same set of strings.

## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

None.

## CHANGE HISTORY

### First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.

### Issue 5

- The DESCRIPTION is updated for alignment with the POSIX Realtime Extension.
- Large File Summit extensions are added.

### Issue 6

The following new requirements on POSIX implementations derive from alignment with the Single UNIX Specification:

- In the DESCRIPTION, the use and setting of the `mode` argument are changed to include binary streams.
- In the DESCRIPTION, text is added for large file support to indicate setting of the offset maximum in the open file description.
- All errors identified in the ERRORS section are added.
- In the DESCRIPTION, text is added that the `fdopen()` function may cause `st_atime` to be updated.

The following changes were made to align with the IEEE P1003.1a draft standard:

- Clarification is added that it is the responsibility of the application to ensure that the mode is compatible with the open file descriptor.

The DESCRIPTION is updated for alignment with IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000 by specifying that `fdopen()` results are unspecified for typed memory objects.

IEEE Std 1003.1-2001/Cor 2-2004, item XSH/TC2/D6/30 is applied, making corrections to the RATIONALE.

### Issue 7

- SD5-XSH-ERN-149 is applied, adding the {STREAM_MAX} [EMFILE] error condition.
- Changes are made related to support for finegrained timestamps.
- POSIX.1-2008, Technical Corrigendum 1, XSH/TC1-2008/0121 [409] is applied.

### Issue 8

- Austin Group Defects 411 and 1526 are applied, changing the requirements for the `mode` argument.
