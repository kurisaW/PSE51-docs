# exit

## NAME

exit — terminate a process

## SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void exit(int status);
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `exit()` function shall cause normal process termination to occur. No functions registered by the `at_quick_exit()` function shall be called. If a process calls the `exit()` function more than once, or calls the `quick_exit()` function in addition to the `exit()` function, the behavior is undefined.

The value of `status` can be 0, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `EXIT_FAILURE`, or any other value, though only the least significant 8 bits (that is, `status` & 0377) shall be available from `wait()` and `waitpid()`; the full value shall be available from `waitid()` and in the `siginfo_t` passed to a signal handler for SIGCHLD.

The `exit()` function shall first call all functions registered by `atexit()`, in the reverse order of their registration, except that a function is called after any previously registered functions that had already been called at the time it was registered. Each function is called as many times as it was registered. If, during the call to any such function, a call to the `longjmp()` function is made that would terminate the call to the registered function, the behavior is undefined.

If a function registered by a call to `atexit()` fails to return, the remaining registered functions shall not be called and the rest of the `exit()` processing shall not be completed.

The `exit()` function shall then flush all open streams with unwritten buffered data. For each stream which is the active handle to its underlying file descriptor, and for which the file is not already at EOF and is capable of seeking, the file offset of the underlying open file description shall be set to the file position of the stream. For each open stream, the `exit()` function shall perform the equivalent of a `close()` on the file descriptor that is associated with the stream. Finally, the process shall be terminated with the same consequences as described in _Consequences of Process Termination_.

## RETURN VALUE

The `exit()` function does not return.

## ERRORS

No errors are defined.

## EXAMPLES

See APPLICATION USAGE.

## APPLICATION USAGE

When a stream that has unwritten buffered data is flushed by `exit()` there is no way for the calling process to discover whether or not `exit()` successfully wrote the data to the underlying file descriptor. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that applications always ensure there is no unwritten buffered data in any stream when calling `exit()`, or returning from the initial call to `main()`, with a `status` value that indicates no errors occurred.

For example, the following code demonstrates one way to ensure that `stdout` has already been successfully flushed before calling `exit()` with status 0. If the flush fails, the file descriptor underlying `stdout` is closed so that `exit()` will not try to repeat the failed write operation. If the flush succeeds, a final check with `ferror()` is performed to ensure that there were no write errors during earlier flush operations (that were not handled at the time).

```c
int status = 0;
if (fflush(stdout) != 0) {
    perror("appname: standard output");
    close(fileno(stdout));
    status = 1;
}
else if (ferror(stdout)) {
    fputs("appname: write error on standard output\n", stderr);
    status = 1;
}
exit(status);
```
