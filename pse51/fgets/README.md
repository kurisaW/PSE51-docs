## NAME

`fgets` — get a string from a stream

## SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char *fgets(char *restrict s, int n, FILE *restrict stream);
```

## DESCRIPTION

The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1-2024 defers to the ISO C standard.

The `fgets()` function shall read bytes from `stream` into the array pointed to by `s` until `n`-1 bytes are read, or a `<newline>` is read and transferred to `s`, or an end-of-file condition is encountered. A null byte shall be written immediately after the last byte read into the array. If the end-of-file condition is encountered before any bytes are read, the contents of the array pointed to by `s` shall not be changed.

The `fgets()` function may mark the last data access timestamp of the file associated with `stream` for update. The last data access timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful execution of `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fread()`, `fscanf()`, `getc()`, `getchar()`, `getdelim()`, `getline()`, or `scanf()` using `stream` that returns data not supplied by a prior call to `ungetc()`.

## RETURN VALUE

Upon successful completion, `fgets()` shall return `s`. If the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream shall be set and `fgets()` shall return a null pointer. If an error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set, `fgets()` shall return a null pointer, and shall set `errno` to indicate the error.

## ERRORS

Refer to `fgetc()`.

## EXAMPLES

### Reading Input

The following example uses `fgets()` to read lines of input. It assumes that the file it is reading is a text file and that lines in this text file are no longer than 16384 (or {LINE_MAX} if it is less than 16384 on the implementation where it is running) bytes long. (Note that the standard utilities have no line length limit if `sysconf(_SC_LINE_MAX)` returns -1 without setting `errno`. This example assumes that `sysconf(_SC_LINE_MAX)` will not fail.)

```c
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define MYLIMIT 16384

char *line;
int line_max;

if (LINE_MAX >= MYLIMIT) {
    /* Use maximum line size of MYLIMIT. If LINE_MAX is
       bigger than our limit, sysconf() cannot report a
       smaller limit. */
    line_max = MYLIMIT;
} else {
    long limit = sysconf(_SC_LINE_MAX);
    line_max = (limit < 0 || limit > MYLIMIT) ? MYLIMIT : (int)limit;
}

/* line_max + 1 leaves room for the null byte added by fgets(). */
line = malloc(line_max + 1);
if (line == NULL) {
    /* out of space */
    ...
    return error;
}

while (fgets(line, line_max + 1, fp) != NULL) {
    /* Verify that a full line has been read ... */
    /* If not, report an error or prepare to treat the
       next time through the loop as a read of a
       continuation of the current line. */
    ...
    /* Process line ... */
    ...
}
free(line);
...
```

## CHANGE HISTORY

### First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.

### Issue 6

Extensions beyond the ISO C standard are marked.

The prototype for `fgets()` is changed for alignment with the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard.

### Issue 7

Austin Group Interpretation 1003.1-2001 #051 is applied, updating the list of functions that mark the last data access timestamp for update.

POSIX.1-2008, Technical Corrigendum 1, XSH/TC1-2008/0134 [182] and XSH/TC1-2008/0135 [14] are applied.

POSIX.1-2008, Technical Corrigendum 2, XSH/TC2-2008/0114 [468] is applied.

### Issue 8

Austin Group Defect 1330 is applied, removing obsolescent interfaces.

Austin Group Defect 1624 is applied, changing the RETURN VALUE section.
