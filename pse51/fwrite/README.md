# fwrite — binary output

## SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <stdio.h>

size_t fwrite(const void *restrict ptr,
              size_t size,
              size_t nitems,
              FILE *restrict stream);
```

## DESCRIPTION

[CX] The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1-2024 defers to the ISO C standard.

The `fwrite()` function shall write, from the array pointed to by `ptr`, up to `nitems` elements whose size is specified by `size`, to the stream pointed to by `stream`. For each object, `size` calls shall be made to the `fputc()` function, taking the values (in order) from an array of **unsigned char** exactly overlaying the object. The file-position indicator for the stream (if defined) shall be advanced by the number of bytes successfully written. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file-position indicator for the stream is unspecified.

[CX] The last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file shall be marked for update between the successful execution of `fwrite()` and the next successful completion of a call to `fflush()` or `fclose()` on the same stream, or a call to `exit()` or `abort()`.

## RETURN VALUE

The `fwrite()` function shall return the number of elements successfully written, which shall be less than `nitems` only if a write error is encountered. If `size` or `nitems` is 0, `fwrite()` shall return 0 and the state of the stream remains unchanged. Otherwise, if a write error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set, [CX] and `errno` shall be set to indicate the error.

## ERRORS

Refer to `fputc()`.

*The following sections are informative.*

## EXAMPLES

None.

## APPLICATION USAGE

Because of possible differences in element length and byte ordering, files written using `fwrite()` are application-dependent, and possibly cannot be read using `fread()` by a different application or by the same application on a different processor.

## RATIONALE

None.

## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

None.

## CHANGE HISTORY

First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.

### Issue 6

Extensions beyond the ISO C standard are marked.

The following changes are made for alignment with the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard:

- The `fwrite()` prototype is updated.
- The DESCRIPTION is updated to clarify how the data is written out using `fputc()`.

### Issue 7

Changes are made related to support for finegrained timestamps.

POSIX.1-2008, Technical Corrigendum 1, XSH/TC1-2008/0228 [14] is applied.

### Issue 8

Austin Group Defect 1196 is applied, clarifying the RETURN VALUE section.
