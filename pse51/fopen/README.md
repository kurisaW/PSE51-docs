# fopen — open a stream

## SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *fopen(const char *restrict pathname, const char *restrict mode);
```

## DESCRIPTION

Except for the "exclusive access" requirement (see below), the functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any other conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1-2024 defers to the ISO C standard for all `fopen()` functionality except in relation to "exclusive access".

The `fopen()` function shall open the file whose pathname is the string pointed to by `pathname`, and associates a stream with it.

The `mode` argument points to a character string. The behavior is unspecified if any character occurs more than once in the string. If the string begins with one of the following characters, then the file shall be opened in the indicated mode. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

- **'r'**: Open file for reading.
- **'w'**: Truncate to zero length or create file for writing.
- **'a'**: Append; open or create file for writing at end-of-file.

The remainder of the string can contain any of the following characters, in any order, and further affect how the file is opened:

- **'b'**: This character shall have no effect, but is allowed for ISO C standard conformance.
- **'e'**: The underlying file descriptor shall have the FD_CLOEXEC flag atomically set.
- **'x'**: If the first character of `mode` is 'w' or 'a', then the function shall fail if the file already exists, or cannot be created; if the file does not exist and can be created, it shall be created with an implementation-defined form of exclusive (also known as non-shared) access, if supported by the underlying file system, provided the resulting file permissions are the same as they would be without the 'x' modifier. If the first character of mode is 'r', the effect is implementation-defined.

**Note:**

The ISO C standard requires exclusive access "to the extent that the underlying file system supports exclusive access", but does not define what it means by this. Taken at face value—that systems must do whatever they are capable of, at the file system level, in order to exclude access by others—this would require POSIX.1 systems to set the file permissions in a way that prevents access by other users and groups. Consequently, this volume of POSIX.1-2024 does not defer to the ISO C standard as regards the "exclusive access" requirement.

- **'+'**: The file shall be opened for update (both reading and writing), rather than just reading or just writing.

Opening a file with read mode ('r' as the first character in the `mode` argument) shall fail if the file does not exist or cannot be read.

Opening a file with append mode ('a' as the first character in the `mode` argument) shall cause all subsequent writes to the file to be forced to the then current end-of-file, regardless of intervening calls to `fseek()`.

When a file is opened with update mode ('+' in the `mode` argument), both input and output can be performed on the associated stream. However, the application shall ensure that output is not directly followed by input without an intervening call to `fflush()` or to a file positioning function (`fseek()`, `fsetpos()`, or `rewind()`), and input is not directly followed by output without an intervening call to a file positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-of-file.

When opened, a stream is fully buffered if and only if it can be determined not to refer to an interactive device. The error and end-of-file indicators for the stream shall be cleared.

If the first character in `mode` is 'w' or 'a' and the file did not previously exist, upon successful completion, `fopen()` shall mark for update the last data access, last data modification, and last file status change timestamps of the file and the last file status change and last data modification timestamps of the parent directory.

If the first character in `mode` is 'w' or 'a' and the file did not previously exist, the `fopen()` function shall create a file as if it called the `open()` function with a value appropriate for the path argument interpreted from `pathname`, a value for the oflag argument as specified below, and a value of S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH for the third argument.

If the first character in `mode` is 'w' and the file did previously exist, upon successful completion, `fopen()` shall mark for update the last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file.

After a successful call to the `fopen()` function, the orientation of the stream shall be cleared, the encoding rule shall be cleared, and the associated mbstate_t object shall be set to describe an initial conversion state.

The file descriptor associated with the opened stream shall be allocated and opened as if by a call to `open()` using the following flags:

| fopen() Mode First Character | fopen() Mode Includes '+' | Initial open() Flags |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 'r'                        | no                       | O_RDONLY            |
| 'w'                        | no                       | O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC |
| 'a'                        | no                       | O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND |
| 'r'                        | yes                      | O_RDWR              |
| 'w'                        | yes                      | O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC |
| 'a'                        | yes                      | O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_APPEND |

If, and only if, the 'e' mode string character is specified, the O_CLOEXEC flag shall be OR'ed into the initial `open()` flags specified in the above table.

If, and only if, the 'x' mode string character is specified together with either 'w' or 'a', the O_EXCL flag shall be OR'ed into the initial `open()` flags specified in the above table.

If mode includes 'x' and the underlying file system supports exclusive access (see above) enabled by the use of implementation-specific flags to `open()`, then the behavior shall be as if those flags are also included.

When using mode strings specified by this standard, the implementation shall behave as if no other flags had been passed to `open()`.

## RETURN VALUE

Upon successful completion, `fopen()` shall return a pointer to the object controlling the stream. Otherwise, a null pointer shall be returned, and errno shall be set to indicate the error.

## ERRORS

The `fopen()` function shall fail if:

- **[EACCES]**: Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix, or the file exists and the permissions specified by mode are denied, or the file does not exist and write permission is denied for the parent directory of the file to be created.
- **[EEXIST]**: The mode argument begins with w or a and includes x, but the file already exists.
- **[EILSEQ]**: The mode argument begins with w or a, the file did not previously exist, and the last pathname component is not a portable filename and cannot be created in the target directory.
- **[EINTR]**: A signal was caught during `fopen()`.
- **[EISDIR]**: The named file is a directory and mode requires write access.
- **[ELOOP]**: A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the pathname argument.
- **[EMFILE]**: All file descriptors available to the process are currently open.
- **[EMFILE]**: {STREAM_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling process.
- **[ENAMETOOLONG]**: The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.
- **[ENFILE]**: The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.
- **[ENOENT]**: The mode string begins with 'r' and a component of pathname does not name an existing file, or mode begins with 'w' or 'a' and a component of the path prefix of pathname does not name an existing file, or pathname is an empty string.
- **[ENOENT] or [ENOTDIR]**: The pathname argument contains at least one non-\<slash> character and ends with one or more trailing \<slash> characters. If pathname without the trailing \<slash> characters would name an existing file, an [ENOENT] error shall not occur.
- **[ENOSPC]**: The directory or file system that would contain the new file cannot be expanded, the file does not exist, and the file was to be created.
- **[ENOTDIR]**: A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the pathname argument contains at least one non-\<slash> character and ends with one or more trailing \<slash> characters and the last pathname component names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.
- **[ENXIO]**: The named file is a character special or block special file, and the device associated with this special file does not exist.
- **[EOVERFLOW]**: The named file is a regular file and the size of the file cannot be represented correctly in an object of type off_t.
- **[EROFS]**: The named file resides on a read-only file system and mode requires write access.

The `fopen()` function may fail if:

- **[EINVAL]**: The value of the mode argument is not valid.
- **[ELOOP]**: More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the pathname argument.
- **[EMFILE]**: {FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling process.
- **[ENAMETOOLONG]**: The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.
- **[ENOMEM]**: Insufficient storage space is available.
- **[ETXTBSY]**: The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being executed and mode requires write access.

## EXAMPLES

### Opening a File

The following example tries to open the file named file for reading. The `fopen()` function returns a file pointer that is used in subsequent `fgets()` and `fclose()` calls. If the program cannot open the file, it just ignores it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
...
FILE *fp;
...
void rgrep(const char *file)
{
...
    if ((fp = fopen(file, "r")) == NULL)
        return;
...
}
```

## APPLICATION USAGE

If an application needs to create a file in a way that fails if the file already exists, and either requires that it does not have exclusive access to the file or does not need exclusive access, it should use `open()` with the O_CREAT and O_EXCL flags instead of using `fopen()` with an 'x' in the mode. A stream can then be created, if needed, by calling `fdopen()` on the file descriptor returned by `open()`.

## RATIONALE

The 'e' mode character is provided as a convenience to avoid a data race in multi-threaded applications. Without it, a file descriptor is leaked into a child process created by one thread in the window between another thread creating a file descriptor with `fopen()` and then using `fileno()` and `fcntl()` to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag. It is also possible to avoid the race by using `open()` with O_CLOEXEC followed by `fdopen()`, however, there is no safe alternative for the `freopen()` function, and consistency dictates that the 'e' modifier should be standardized for all functions that accept mode strings.

The ISO C standard only recognizes the '+', 'b', and 'x' characters in certain positions of the mode string, leaving other arrangements as unspecified, and only permits 'x' in mode strings beginning with 'w'. This standard specifically requires support for all characters other than the first in the mode string to be recognized in any order. Thus, "wxe" and "wex" behave the same, and while "wx+" is unspecified in the ISO C standard, this standard requires it to have the same behavior as "w+x". This standard also requires that 'x' work for mode strings beginning with 'a', as well as having implementation-defined behavior for mode strings beginning with 'r'. Therefore, while `open()` has undefined behavior if O_EXCL is specified without O_CREAT, the same is not true of `fopen()`.

When 'x' is in mode, the ISO C standard requires that the file is created with exclusive access to the extent that the underlying system supports exclusive access. Although POSIX.1 does not specify any method of enabling exclusive access, it allows for the existence of an implementation-specific flag, or flags, that enable it. Note that they should be file creation flags if a file is being created, not file access mode flags (that is, ones that are included in O_ACCMODE) or file status flags, so that they do not affect the value returned by `fcntl()` with F_GETFL. On implementations that have such flags, if support for them is file system dependent and exclusive access is requested when using `fopen()` to create a file on a file system that does not support it, the flags must not be used if they would cause `fopen()` to fail.

Some implementations support mandatory file locking as a means of enabling exclusive access to a file. Locks are set in the normal way, but instead of only preventing others from setting conflicting locks they prevent others from accessing the contents of the locked part of the file in a way that conflicts with the lock. However, unless the implementation has a way of setting a whole-file write lock on file creation, this does not satisfy the requirement in the ISO C standard that the file is "created with exclusive access to the extent that the underlying system supports exclusive access". (Having `fopen()` create the file and set a lock on the file as two separate operations is not the same, and it would introduce a race condition whereby another process could open the file and write to it (or set a lock) in between the two operations.) However, on all implementations that support mandatory file locking, its use is discouraged; therefore, it is recommended that implementations which support mandatory file locking do not add a means of creating a file with a whole-file exclusive lock set, so that `fopen()` is not required to enable mandatory file locking in order to conform to the ISO C standard. An implementation that has a means of creating a file with a whole-file exclusive lock set would need to provide a way to change the behavior of `fopen()` depending on whether the calling process is executing in a POSIX.1 conforming environment or an ISO C conforming environment.

The typical implementation-defined behavior for mode "rx" is to ignore the 'x', but the standard developers did not wish to mandate this behavior. For example, an implementation could allow shared access for reading; that is, disallow a file that has been opened this way from also being opened for writing.

Implementations are encouraged to have `fopen()` and `freopen()` report an [EILSEQ] error if mode begins with 'w' or 'a', the file did not previously exist, and the last component of pathname contains any bytes that have the encoded value of a \<newline> character.
