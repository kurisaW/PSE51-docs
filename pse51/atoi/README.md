# atoi — convert a string to an integer

## SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int atoi(const char *str);
```

## DESCRIPTION

[CX] The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1-2024 defers to the ISO C standard.

The call `atoi(str)` shall be equivalent to:

```c
(int) strtol(str, (char **)NULL, 10)
```

except that the handling of errors may differ. If the value cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined.

## RETURN VALUE

The `atoi()` function shall return the converted value if the value can be represented.

## ERRORS

No errors are defined.

## EXAMPLES

### Converting an Argument

The following example checks for proper usage of the program. If there is an argument and the decimal conversion of this argument (obtained using `atoi()`) is greater than 0, then the program has a valid number of minutes to wait for an event.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
...
int minutes_to_event;
...
if (argc < 2 || (minutes_to_event = atoi(argv[1])) <= 0) {
   fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s minutes\n", argv[0]); exit(1);
}
...
```

## APPLICATION USAGE

The `atoi()` function is subsumed by `strtol()` but is retained because it is used extensively in existing code. If the number is not known to be in range, `strtol()` should be used because `atoi()` is not required to perform any error checking.

## RATIONALE

None.

## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

None.

## SEE ALSO

- `strtol()`
- `<stdlib.h>`

## CHANGE HISTORY

First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.

### Issue 8

Austin Group Defect 1541 is applied, changing the EXAMPLES section.
