#include <stdio.h>

[CX] int asprintf(char **restrict ptr, const char *restrict format, ...);
[CX] int dprintf(int fildes, const char *restrict format, ...);
int fprintf(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict format, ...);

```

## DESCRIPTION

[CX] Except for `asprintf()`, `dprintf()`, and the behavior of the `%lc` conversion when passed a null wide character, the functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any other conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1-2024 defers to the ISO C standard for all `fprintf()`, `printf()`, `snprintf()`, and `sprintf()` functionality except in relation to the `%lc` conversion when passed a null wide character.

The `fprintf()` function shall place output on the named output `stream`. The `printf()` function shall place output on the standard output stream `stdout`. The `sprintf()` function shall place output followed by the null byte, '\0', in consecutive bytes starting at `*s`; it is the user's responsibility to ensure that enough space is available.

[CX] The `asprintf()` function shall be equivalent to `sprintf()`, except that the output string shall be written to dynamically allocated memory, allocated as if by a call to `malloc()`, of sufficient length to hold the resulting string, including a terminating null byte. If the call to `asprintf()` is successful, the address of this dynamically allocated string shall be stored in the location referenced by `ptr`.

The `dprintf()` function shall be equivalent to the `fprintf()` function, except that `dprintf()` shall write output to the file associated with the file descriptor specified by the `fildes` argument rather than place output on a stream.

The `snprintf()` function shall be equivalent to `sprintf()`, with the addition of the `n` argument which limits the number of bytes written to the buffer referred to by `s`. If `n` is zero, nothing shall be written and `s` may be a null pointer. Otherwise, output bytes beyond the `n`-1st shall be discarded instead of being written to the array, and a null byte is written at the end of the bytes actually written into the array.

If copying takes place between objects that overlap as a result of a call to `sprintf()` or `snprintf()`, the results are undefined.

Each of these functions converts, formats, and prints its arguments under control of the `format`. The application shall ensure that the format is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format is composed of zero or more directives: **ordinary characters**, which are simply copied to the output stream, and **conversion specifications**, each of which shall result in the fetching of zero or more arguments. The results are undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the format. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments shall be evaluated but are otherwise ignored.

[CX] Conversions can be applied to the n-th argument after the `format` in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument. In this case, the conversion specifier character % (see below) is replaced by the sequence "%n$", where n is a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}], giving the position of the argument in the argument list. This feature provides for the definition of format strings that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific languages (see the EXAMPLES section).

The `format` can contain either numbered argument conversion specifications (that is, those introduced by "%n$" and optionally containing the "*m$" forms of field width and precision), or unnumbered argument conversion specifications (that is, those introduced by the % character and optionally containing the * form of field width and precision), but not both. The only exception to this is that %% can be mixed with the "%n$" form. The results of mixing numbered and unnumbered argument specifications in a format string are undefined. When numbered argument specifications are used, specifying the N-th argument requires that all the leading arguments, from the first to the (N-1)th, are specified in the format string.

In format strings containing the "%n$" form of conversion specification, numbered arguments in the argument list can be referenced from the format string as many times as required.

In format strings containing the % form of conversion specification, each conversion specification uses the first unused argument in the argument list.

[CX] All forms of the `fprintf()` functions allow for the insertion of a language-dependent radix character in the output string. The radix character is defined in the current locale (category `LC_NUMERIC`). In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix character shall default to a <period> ('.').

Each conversion specification is introduced by the '%' character [CX] or by the character sequence "%n$", after which the following appear in sequence:

* Zero or more **flags** (in any order), which modify the meaning of the conversion specification.
* An optional minimum **field width**. If the converted value has fewer bytes than the field width, it shall be padded with <space> characters by default on the left; it shall be padded on the right if the left-adjustment flag ('-'), described below, is given to the field width. The field width takes the form of an <asterisk> ('*'), [CX] or in conversion specifications introduced by "%n$" the "*m$" string, described below, or a decimal integer.
* An optional **precision** that gives the minimum number of digits to appear for the d, i, o, u, x, and X conversion specifiers; the number of digits to appear after the radix character for the a, A, e, E, f, and F conversion specifiers; the maximum number of significant digits for the g and G conversion specifiers; or the maximum number of bytes to be printed from a string in the s [XSI] and S conversion specifiers. The precision takes the form of a <period> ('.') followed either by an <asterisk> ('*'), [CX] or in conversion specifications introduced by "%n$" the "*m$" string, described below, or an optional decimal digit string, where a null digit string is treated as zero. If a precision appears with any other conversion specifier, the behavior is undefined.
* An optional **length modifier** that specifies the size of the argument.
* A **conversion specifier** character that indicates the type of conversion to be applied.

A field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated by an <asterisk> ('*'). In this case an argument of type `int` supplies the field width or precision. Applications shall ensure that arguments specifying field width, or precision, or both appear in that order before the argument, if any, to be converted. A negative field width is taken as a '-' flag followed by a positive field width. A negative precision is taken as if the precision were omitted. [CX] In format strings containing conversion specifications introduced by "%n$", in addition to being indicated by the decimal digit string, a field width may be indicated by the sequence "*m$" and precision by the sequence ".*m$", where m is a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}] giving the position in the argument list (after the `format` argument) of an integer argument containing the field width or precision, for example:

```c
printf("%1$d:%2$.*3$d:%4$.*3$d\n", hour, min, precision, sec);
```

### Flag Characters

The flag characters and their meanings are:

**'** (apostrophe)
[CX] The integer portion of the result of a decimal conversion (%i, %d, %u, %f, %F, %g, or %G) shall be formatted with thousands' grouping characters. For other conversions the behavior is undefined. The non-monetary grouping character is used.

**-**
The result of the conversion shall be left-justified within the field. The conversion is right-justified if this flag is not specified.

**+**
The result of a signed conversion shall always begin with a sign ('+' or '-'). The conversion shall begin with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not specified.

**<space>**
If the first character of a signed conversion is not a sign or if a signed conversion results in no characters, a <space> shall be prefixed to the result. This means that if the <space> and '+' flags both appear, the <space> flag shall be ignored.

**#**
Specifies that the value is to be converted to an alternative form. For o conversion, it shall increase the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a zero (if the value and precision are both 0, a single 0 is printed). For x or X conversion specifiers, a non-zero result shall have 0x (or 0X) prefixed to it. For a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversion specifiers, the result shall always contain a radix character, even if no digits follow the radix character. Without this flag, a radix character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it. For g and G conversion specifiers, trailing zeros shall **not** be removed from the result as they normally are. For other conversion specifiers, the behavior is undefined.

**0**
For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversion specifiers, leading zeros (following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width rather than performing space padding, except when converting an infinity or NaN. If the '0' and '-' flags both appear, the '0' flag is ignored. For d, i, o, u, x, and X conversion specifiers, if a precision is specified, the '0' flag shall be ignored. [CX] If the '0' and <apostrophe> flags both appear, the grouping characters are inserted before zero padding. For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.

### Length Modifiers

The length modifiers and their meanings are:

**hh**
Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to a `signed char` or `unsigned char` argument (the argument will have been promoted according to the integer promotions, but its value shall be converted to `signed char` or `unsigned char` before printing); or that a following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `signed char` argument.

**h**
Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to a `short` or `unsigned short` argument (the argument will have been promoted according to the integer promotions, but its value shall be converted to `short` or `unsigned short` before printing); or that a following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `short` argument.

**l** (ell)
Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to a `long` or `unsigned long` argument; that a following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `long` argument; that a following c conversion specifier applies to a `wint_t` argument; that a following s conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `wchar_t` argument; or has no effect on a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier.

**ll** (ell-ell)
Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to a `long long` or `unsigned long long` argument; or that a following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `long long` argument.

**j**
Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to an `intmax_t` or `uintmax_t` argument; or that a following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to an `intmax_t` argument.

**z**
Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to a `size_t` or the corresponding signed integer type argument; or that a following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a signed integer type corresponding to a `size_t` argument.

**t**
Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to a `ptrdiff_t` or the corresponding `unsigned` type argument; or that a following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `ptrdiff_t` argument.

**L**
Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier applies to a `long double` argument.

If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as specified above, the behavior is undefined.

### Conversion Specifiers

The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

**d, i**
The `int` argument shall be converted to a signed decimal in the style "[-]dddd". The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting zero with an explicit precision of zero shall be no characters.

**o**
The `unsigned` argument shall be converted to unsigned octal format in the style "dddd". The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting zero with an explicit precision of zero shall be no characters.

**u**
The `unsigned` argument shall be converted to unsigned decimal format in the style "dddd". The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting zero with an explicit precision of zero shall be no characters.

**x**
The `unsigned` argument shall be converted to unsigned hexadecimal format in the style "dddd"; the letters "abcdef" are used. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting zero with an explicit precision of zero shall be no characters.

**X**
Equivalent to the x conversion specifier, except that letters "ABCDEF" are used instead of "abcdef".

**f, F**
The `double` argument shall be converted to decimal notation in the style "[-]ddd.ddd", where the number of digits after the radix character is equal to the precision specification. If the precision is missing, it shall be taken as 6; if the precision is explicitly zero and no '#' flag is present, no radix character shall appear. If a radix character appears, at least one digit appears before it. The low-order digit shall be rounded in an implementation-defined manner.

A `double` argument representing an infinity shall be converted in one of the styles "[-]inf" or "[-]infinity"; which style is implementation-defined. A `double` argument representing a NaN shall be converted in one of the styles "[-]nan(n-char-sequence)" or "[-]nan"; which style, and the meaning of any n-char-sequence, is implementation-defined. The F conversion specifier produces "INF", "INFINITY", or "NAN" instead of "inf", "infinity", or "nan", respectively.

**e, E**
The `double` argument shall be converted in the style "[-]d.ddd_e±dd", where there is one digit before the radix character (which is non-zero if the argument is non-zero) and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it shall be taken as 6; if the precision is zero and no '#' flag is present, no radix character shall appear. The low-order digit shall be rounded in an implementation-defined manner. The E conversion specifier shall produce a number with 'E' instead of 'e' introducing the exponent. The exponent shall always contain at least two digits. If the value is zero, the exponent shall be zero.

A `double` argument representing an infinity or NaN shall be converted in the style of an f or F conversion specifier.

**g, G**
The `double` argument representing a floating-point number shall be converted in the style f or e (or in the style F or E in the case of a G conversion specifier), depending on the value converted and the precision. Let P equal the precision if non-zero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero. Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X:

* If P>X>=-4, the conversion shall be with style f (or F) and precision P-(X+1).
* Otherwise, the conversion shall be with style e (or E) and precision P-1.

Finally, unless the '#' flag is used, any trailing zeros shall be removed from the fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point character shall be removed if there is no fractional portion remaining.

A `double` argument representing an infinity or NaN shall be converted in the style of an f or F conversion specifier.

**a, A**
A `double` argument representing a floating-point number shall be converted in the style "[-]0x_h._hhhh_p±d", where there is one hexadecimal digit (which shall be non-zero if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and is otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point character and the number of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, then the precision shall be sufficient for an exact representation of the value; if the precision is missing and FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the precision shall be sufficient to distinguish values of type `double`, except that trailing zeros may be omitted; if the precision is zero and the '#' flag is not specified, no decimal-point character shall appear. The letters "abcdef" shall be used for a conversion and the letters "ABCDEF" for A conversion. The A conversion specifier produces a number with 'X' and 'P' instead of 'x' and 'p'. The exponent shall always contain at least one digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent shall be zero.

A `double` argument representing an infinity or NaN shall be converted in the style of an f or F conversion specifier.

**c**
The `int` argument shall be converted to an `unsigned char`, and the resulting byte shall be written.

If an l (ell) qualifier is present, [CX] the `wint_t` argument shall be converted to a multi-byte sequence as if by a call to `wcrtomb()` with a pointer to storage of at least MB_CUR_MAX bytes, the `wint_t` argument converted to `wchar_t`, and an initial shift state, and the resulting byte(s) written.

**s**
The argument shall be a pointer to an array of `char`. Bytes from the array shall be written up to (but not including) any terminating null byte. If the precision is specified, no more than that many bytes shall be written. If the precision is not specified or is greater than the size of the array, the application shall ensure that the array contains a null byte.

If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to an array of type `wchar_t`. Wide characters from the array shall be converted to characters (each as if by a call to the `wcrtomb()` function, with the conversion state described by an `mbstate_t` object initialized to zero before the first wide character is converted) up to and including a terminating null wide character. The resulting characters shall be written up to (but not including) the terminating null character (byte). If no precision is specified, the application shall ensure that the array contains a null wide character. If a precision is specified, no more than that many characters (bytes) shall be written (including shift sequences, if any), and the array shall contain a null wide character if, to equal the character sequence length given by the precision, the function would need to access a wide character one past the end of the array. In no case shall a partial character be written.

**p**
The argument shall be a pointer to `void`. The value of the pointer is converted to a sequence of printable characters, in an implementation-defined manner.

**n**
The argument shall be a pointer to an integer into which is written the number of bytes written to the output so far by this call to one of the `fprintf()` functions. No argument is converted.

**C**
[XSI] Equivalent to lc.

**S**
[XSI] Equivalent to ls.

**%**
Write a '%' character; no argument shall be converted. The application shall ensure that the complete conversion specification is %%.

If a conversion specification does not match one of the above forms, the behavior is undefined. If any argument is not the correct type for the corresponding conversion specification, the behavior is undefined.

In no case shall a nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of a field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field width, the field shall be expanded to contain the conversion result. Characters generated by `fprintf()` and `printf()` are printed as if `fputc()` had been called.

For the a and A conversion specifiers, if FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the value shall be correctly rounded to a hexadecimal floating number with the given precision.

For a and A conversions, if FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2 and the result is not exactly representable in the given precision, the result should be one of the two adjacent numbers in hexadecimal floating style with the given precision, with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

For the e, E, f, F, g, and G conversion specifiers, if the number of significant decimal digits is at most DECIMAL_DIG, then the result should be correctly rounded. If the number of significant decimal digits is more than DECIMAL_DIG but the source value is exactly representable with DECIMAL_DIG digits, then the result should be an exact representation with trailing zeros. Otherwise, the source value is bounded by two adjacent decimal strings L < U, both having DECIMAL_DIG significant digits; the value of the resultant decimal string D should satisfy L <= D <= U, with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

[CX] The last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file shall be marked for update:

1. Between the call to a successful execution of `fprintf()` or `printf()` and the next successful completion of a call to `fflush()` or `fclose()` on the same stream or a call to `exit()` or `abort()`
2. Upon successful completion of a call to `dprintf()`

## RETURN VALUE

Upon successful completion, the [CX] `dprintf()`, `fprintf()`, and `printf()` functions shall return the number of bytes transmitted.

[CX] Upon successful completion, the `asprintf()` function shall return the number of bytes written to the allocated string stored in the location referenced by `ptr`, excluding the terminating null byte.

Upon successful completion, the `sprintf()` function shall return the number of bytes written to `s`, excluding the terminating null byte.

Upon successful completion, the `snprintf()` function shall return the number of bytes that would be written to `s` had `n` been sufficiently large excluding the terminating null byte.

If an error was encountered, these functions shall return a negative value [CX] and set `errno` to indicate the error. For `asprintf()`, if memory allocation was not possible, or if some other error occurs, the function shall return a negative value, and the contents of the location referenced by `ptr` are undefined, but shall not refer to allocated memory.

If the value of `n` is zero on a call to `snprintf()`, nothing shall be written, the number of bytes that would have been written had `n` been sufficiently large excluding the terminating null shall be returned, and `s` may be a null pointer.

## ERRORS

For the conditions under which [CX] `dprintf()`, `fprintf()`, and `printf()` fail and may fail, refer to `fputc()` or `fputwc()`.

In addition, all forms of `fprintf()` shall fail if:

**[EILSEQ]**
[CX] A wide-character code that does not correspond to a valid character has been detected.

**[EOVERFLOW]**
[CX] The value to be returned is greater than {INT_MAX}.

[CX] The `asprintf()` function shall fail if:

**[ENOMEM]**
Insufficient storage space is available.

The `dprintf()` function may fail if:

**[EBADF]**
The `fildes` argument is not a valid file descriptor.

The [CX] `dprintf()`, `fprintf()`, and `printf()` functions may fail if:

**[ENOMEM]**
[CX] Insufficient storage space is available.

## EXAMPLES

### Printing Language-Independent Date and Time

The following statement can be used to print date and time using a language-independent format:

```c
printf(format, weekday, month, day, hour, min);
```

For American usage, `format` could be a pointer to the following string:

```c
"%s, %s %d, %d:%.2d\n"
```

This example would produce the following message:

```
Sunday, July 3, 10:02
```

For German usage, `format` could be a pointer to the following string:

```c
"%1$s, %3$d. %2$s, %4$d:%5$.2d\n"
```

This definition of `format` would produce the following message:

```
Sonntag, 3. Juli, 10:02
```

### Printing File Information

The following example prints information about the type, permissions, and number of links of a specific file in a directory.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <pwd.h>
#include <grp.h>

char *strperm (mode_t);
...
struct stat statbuf;
struct passwd *pwd;
struct group *grp;
...
printf("%10.10s", strperm (statbuf.st_mode));
printf("%4d", statbuf.st_nlink);

if ((pwd = getpwuid(statbuf.st_uid)) != NULL)
    printf(" %-8.8s", pwd->pw_name);
else
    printf(" %-8ld", (long) statbuf.st_uid);

if ((grp = getgrgid(statbuf.st_gid)) != NULL)
    printf(" %-8.8s", grp->gr_name);
else
    printf(" %-8ld", (long) statbuf.st_gid);

printf("%9jd", (intmax_t) statbuf.st_size);
```

### Printing a Localized Date String

The following example gets a localized date string:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <langinfo.h>
...
struct dirent *dp;
struct tm *tm;
char datestring[256];
...
strftime(datestring, sizeof(datestring), nl_langinfo (D_T_FMT), tm);

printf(" %s %s\n", datestring, dp->d_name);
```

### Printing Error Information

The following example uses `fprintf()` to write error information to standard error:

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>

#define LOCKFILE "/etc/ptmp"
#define PASSWDFILE "/etc/passwd"
...
int pfd;
...
if ((pfd = open(LOCKFILE, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL,
    S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH)) == -1)
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open /etc/ptmp. Try again later.\n");
    exit(1);
}
...
if (link(LOCKFILE,PASSWDFILE) == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Link error: %s\n", strerror(errno));
    exit(1);
}
```

### Printing Usage Information

The following example checks to make sure the program has the necessary arguments, and uses `fprintf()` to print usage information if the expected number of arguments is not present:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
...
char *Options = "hdbtl";
...
if (argc < 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s -%s <file\n", argv[0], Options); exit(1);
}
```

### Formatting a Decimal String

The following example prints a key and data pair on `stdout`. Note use of the <asterisk> ('*') in the format string; this ensures the correct number of decimal places for the element based on the number of elements requested:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
...
long i;
char *keystr;
int elementlen, len;
...
while (len < elementlen) {
...
    printf("%s Element%0*ld\n", keystr, elementlen, i);
...
}
```

### Creating a Pathname

The following example creates a pathname using information from a previous `getpwnam()` function that returned the password database entry of the user:

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
...
char *pathname;
struct passwd *pw;
size_t len;
...
// digits required for pid_t is number of bits times
// log2(10) = approx 10/33
len = strlen(pw->pw_dir) + 1 + 1+(sizeof(pid_t)*80+32)/33 +
    sizeof ".out";
pathname = malloc(len);
if (pathname != NULL)
{
    snprintf(pathname, len, "%s/%jd.out", pw->pw_dir,
        (intmax_t)getpid());
    ...
}
```

### Reporting an Event

The following example loops until an event has timed out. The `pause()` function waits forever unless it receives a signal. The `fprintf()` statement should never occur due to the possible return values of `pause()`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
...
while (!event_complete) {
...
    if (pause() != -1 || errno != EINTR)
        fprintf(stderr, "pause: unknown error: %s\n", strerror(errno));
}
```

### Printing Monetary Information

The following example uses `strfmon()` to convert a number and store it as a formatted monetary string named `convbuf`. If the first number is printed, the program prints the format and the description; otherwise, it just prints the number:

```c
#include <monetary.h>
#include <stdio.h>
...
struct tblfmt {
    char *format;
    char *description;
};

struct tblfmt table[] = {
    { "%n", "default formatting" },
    { "%11n", "right align within an 11 character field" },
    { "%#5n", "aligned columns for values up to 99999" },
    { "%=*#5n", "specify a fill character" },
    { "%=0#5n", "fill characters do not use grouping" },
    { "%^#5n", "disable the grouping separator" },
    { "%^#5.0n", "round off to whole units" },
    { "%^#5.4n", "increase the precision" },
    { "%(#5n", "use an alternative pos/neg style" },
    { "%!(#5n", "disable the currency symbol" },
};
...
float input[3];
int i, j;
char convbuf[100];
...
strfmon(convbuf, sizeof(convbuf), table[i].format, input[j]);

if (j == 0) {
    printf("%s  %s      %s\n", table[i].format,
        convbuf, table[i].description);
}
else {
    printf("    %s\n", convbuf);
}
```

### Printing Wide Characters

The following example prints a series of wide characters. Suppose that "L`@`" expands to three bytes:

```c
wchar_t wz [3] = L"@@";       // Zero-terminated
wchar_t wn [3] = L"@@";      // Unterminated

fprintf (stdout,"%ls", wz);   // Outputs 6 bytes
fprintf (stdout,"%ls", wn);   // Undefined because wn has no terminator
fprintf (stdout,"%4ls", wz);  // Outputs 3 bytes
fprintf (stdout,"%4ls", wn);  // Outputs 3 bytes; no terminator needed
fprintf (stdout,"%9ls", wz);  // Outputs 6 bytes
fprintf (stdout,"%9ls", wn);  // Outputs 9 bytes; no terminator needed
fprintf (stdout,"%10ls", wz); // Outputs 6 bytes
fprintf (stdout,"%10ls", wn); // Undefined because wn has no terminator
```

In the last line of the example, after processing three characters, nine bytes have been output. The fourth character must then be examined to determine whether it converts to one byte or more. If it converts to more than one byte, the output is only nine bytes. Since there is no fourth character in the array, the behavior is undefined.

## APPLICATION USAGE

If the application calling `fprintf()` has any objects of type `wint_t` or `wchar_t`, it must also include the `<wchar.h>` header to have these objects defined.

The space allocated by a successful call to `asprintf()` should be subsequently freed by a call to `free()`.

## RATIONALE

If an implementation detects that there are insufficient arguments for the format, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

The behavior specified for the %lc conversion differs slightly from the specification in the ISO C standard, in that printing the null wide character produces a null byte instead of 0 bytes of output as would be required by a strict reading of the ISO C standard's direction to behave as if applying the %ls specifier to a `wchar_t` array whose first element is the null wide character. Requiring a multi-byte output for every possible wide character, including the null character, matches historical practice, and provides consistency with %c in `fprintf()` and with both %c and %lc in `fwprintf()`. It is anticipated that a future edition of the ISO C standard will change to match the behavior specified here.

## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

None.

## CHANGE HISTORY

### First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.

### Issue 5

Aligned with ISO/IEC 9899:1990/Amendment 1:1995 (E). Specifically, the l (ell) qualifier can now be used with c and s conversion specifiers.

The `snprintf()` function is new in Issue 5.

### Issue 6

Extensions beyond the ISO C standard are marked.

The normative text is updated to avoid use of the term "must" for application requirements.

The following changes are made for alignment with the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard:

* The prototypes for `fprintf()`, `printf()`, `snprintf()`, and `sprintf()` are updated, and the XSI shading is removed from `snprintf()`.
* The description of `snprintf()` is aligned with the ISO C standard. Note that this supersedes the `snprintf()` description in The Open Group Base Resolution bwg98-006, which changed the behavior from Issue 5.
* The DESCRIPTION is updated.

The DESCRIPTION is updated to use the terms "conversion specifier" and "conversion specification" consistently.

ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, Technical Corrigendum 1 is incorporated.

An example of printing wide characters is added.

### Issue 7

Austin Group Interpretation 1003.1-2001 #161 is applied, updating the DESCRIPTION of the 0 flag.

Austin Group Interpretation 1003.1-2001 #170 is applied.

ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, Technical Corrigendum 2 #68 (SD5-XSH-ERN-70) is applied, revising the description of g and G.

SD5-XSH-ERN-174 is applied.

The `dprintf()` function is added from The Open Group Technical Standard, 2006, Extended API Set Part 1.

Functionality relating to the %n$ form of conversion specification and the <apostrophe> flag is moved from the XSI option to the Base.

Changes are made related to support for finegrained timestamps.

POSIX.1-2008, Technical Corrigendum 1, XSH/TC1-2008/0163 [302], XSH/TC1-2008/0164 [316], XSH/TC1-2008/0165 [316], XSH/TC1-2008/0166 [451,291], and XSH/TC1-2008/0167 [14] are applied.

POSIX.1-2008, Technical Corrigendum 2, XSH/TC2-2008/0126 [894], XSH/TC2-2008/0127 [557], and XSH/TC2-2008/0128 [936] are applied.

### Issue 8

Austin Group Defect 986 is applied, adding `strlcat()` and `wcslcat()` to the SEE ALSO section.

Austin Group Defect 1020 is applied, clarifying that the `snprintf()` argument `n` limits the number of bytes written to `s`; it is not necessarily the same as the size of `s`.

Austin Group Defect 1021 is applied, changing "output error" to "error" in the RETURN VALUE section.

Austin Group Defect 1137 is applied, clarifying the use of "%n$" and "*m$" in conversion specifications.

Austin Group Defect 1205 is applied, changing the description of the % conversion specifier.

Austin Group Defect 1219 is applied, removing the `snprintf()`-specific [EOVERFLOW] error.

Austin Group Defect 1496 is applied, adding the `asprintf()` function.

Austin Group Defect 1562 is applied, clarifying that it is the application's responsibility to ensure that the format is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.

Austin Group Defect 1647 is applied, changing the description of the c conversion specifier and updating the statement that this volume of POSIX.1-2024 defers to the ISO C standard so that it excludes the %lc conversion when passed a null wide character.
